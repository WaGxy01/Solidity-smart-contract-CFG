# Solidity-smart-contract-CFG
A control flow graph construction tool for EVM bytecode, supporting bytecode disassembly and CFG generation.

## overview
  Currently, mainstream approaches to constructing control flow graphs from Solidity bytecode typically first identify static jump targets and then employ symbolic execution techniques to infer dynamic jump targets. This tool does not utilize symbolic execution; instead, it relies solely on domain knowledge to infer dynamic jump targets. The advantage of this design is faster analysis speed. However, its limitation lies in the inability to fully recover correct control flow paths for bytecode compiled with Solidity version 0.8 and above. This is because changes introduced in version 0.8 result in certain basic blocks having multiple entry sources, making it impossible to accurately derive all jump targets. Therefore, it is recommended to use bytecode generated by compilers below version 0.8 for optimal analysis results.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Recommended Solidity Version: **0.7.x or below**


## Usage
```bash
python main.py example\example.code -v
```
